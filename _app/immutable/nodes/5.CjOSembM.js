This is my first post and I don’t really have strong goals for where I want the blog as a whole to go. It is likely going to be a collection of thoughts on whatever I’m interested in at the time. Its not always going to be about music, but this week it is.</p> <!> <!> <div class="float-left w-md mr-4"><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7aKQNWCBsxQcyTgrxDuOvj?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div> <p>This is a pretty cool album that I ran into while going down a rabbit hole of related artists. It has a vibe that is very much “kol” so i guess it isn’t a surprise that I like it. Its hard to really place the genre of the album but I would maybe label it as indie electronic? Honestly it’s hard to place, but I guess thats why labeling things isn’t always great.</p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this album, and have found myself playing it on repeat for most of the week. I’m not sure what bbpue’s influences are but at times, they remind me of Alex G and LCD Soundsystem. Despite this, I think that it stands strongly on its own. Its production is simple and raw, but in that rawness there is beauty. More than anything i’ve heard in recent times, it has inspired me to make music again.</p> <br class="my-4 block clear-left"> <hr> <p>Side note: After enjoying the album so much, I started looking into the artist and found this on their instagram:</p> <!> <p>I will say I am shocked by both the production quality and the mixing of the album for something produced by a small artist on an iphone.</p> <p><strong>Recommended tracks</strong>: <em>My favorite jeans</em>, <em>Stacy</em>, <em>I ate myself</em>, <em>Stapleface</em></p> <!> <!> <div class="float-left w-md mr-4"><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/03n6VoKqqa3KMlMfyVtMEY?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div> <p>There is something about this track that captures how i’ve been feeling lately.
