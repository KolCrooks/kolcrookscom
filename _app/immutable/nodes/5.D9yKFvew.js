The first song has a vibe thats very much “kol” so it captured my attention immediately. Its hard to really place the genre of it, but I would maybe label the album as indie electronic? Honestly it’s hard to say, but I guess thats why labeling things isn’t always great.</p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this album, and have found myself playing it on repeat for most of the week. Its catchy and familiar, but still fairly unique. At times the album reminds me of Alex G and LCD Soundsystem but It still stands on its own. Its production is simple and raw, but in that rawness there is beauty. More than anything i’ve heard in recent times, it has inspired me to make music again.</p> <br class="my-4 block clear-left"> <hr> <p>Side note: After enjoying the album so much, I started looking into the artist and found this on their instagram:</p> <!> <p>I will say I am shocked by both the production quality and the mixing of the album for something produced by a small artist on an iphone.</p> <p><strong>Recommended tracks</strong>: <em>My favorite jeans</em>, <em>Stacy</em>, <em>I ate myself</em>, <em>Stapleface</em></p> <!> <!> <div class="float-left w-md mr-4"><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/03n6VoKqqa3KMlMfyVtMEY?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div> <p>There is something about this track that captures how i’ve been feeling lately.
